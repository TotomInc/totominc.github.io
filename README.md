# About
This is an old repository that I manage only when I have some time. You will find all my old projects, that I made when I was learning programming, especially web tehcnologies. Don't take any sample code of this repo as a good example, they are of very poor quality.

### Blackmarket - incremental-game
Another simple incremental-game, about selling drugs. You start with only a gun, and you have to build a drug empire to become trillionnaire. Blackmarket was my first really big project about in HTML/CSS/JS. It has been totally re-done : scripts and interface. Blackmarket has reach its official release, take a look now!

### Incremental-RPG
My very second project in JS, where I wanted to focus more on design using Bootstrap and some free themes.

### Idle-Quester
Idle-Quester is a web version of the original app/game [Idle-Quest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.topcog.idlequest.android) for Android.

### Money-Life (old)
My very first small project to learn JS, it's just an [Adventure Capitalist](http://www.kongregate.com/games/hyperhippogames/adventure-capitalist) clone.

### Money-Life (beta-prototype)
Another attempt at adding more gameplay mechanics for Money-Life.

### Universe-God (old)
Another prototype were you rebuild the universe with your god's hands. It got some decent showcase on /r/incremental_games, maybe I will pick it up one day...

### Fallout terminal
A very cool Fallout-like terminal effect made mainly with CSS.
