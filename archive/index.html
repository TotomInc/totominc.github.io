  <p>This is an old repository that I manage only when I have some time. You will find all my old projects, that I made when I was learning programming, especially web tehcnologies. Don't take any sample code of this repo as a good example, they are of very poor quality.</p>
  
  <h3 id="blackmarketincrementalgamehttpsarchivetotomincioblackmarket"><a href="https://archive.totominc.io/blackmarket">Blackmarket - incremental-game</a></h3>
  
  <p>Another simple incremental-game, about selling drugs. You start with only a gun, and you have to build a drug empire to become trillionnaire. Blackmarket was my first really big project about in HTML/CSS/JS. It has been totally re-done : scripts and interface. Blackmarket has reach its official release, take a look now!</p>

  <p>My very second project in JS, where I wanted to focus more on design using Bootstrap and some free themes.</p>
